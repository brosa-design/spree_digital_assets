[SpreeDigitalAssets](http://vinsol.com/spreecommerce-digital-asset-management)
==================

This gem allows you to have a central repository of the assets. The assets can be uploaded well
in advance and can be associated with the products/variants at the time of product/variant
creation.

This will also act as a central repository that can be used to access all the assets of the system
and can then be used in different products.

## Features

* Has default folders “Documents”, “Photos” and “Graphics”

* Assets can be uploaded to each folder by using the upload feature

* Ability to view assets in List view

* Excellent UI

* Ability to remove / edit / download each asset

* Associate assets while creating product / variant
